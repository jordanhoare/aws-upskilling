# 📝 Description

This code provisions an AWS API Gateway- and Lambda-based website, and uses DynamoDB to store the hit counter. All infrastructure is "serverless" and pay per usage so there aren't any persistent servers. The project is defined in Python infrastructure as code so that it's easy to spin up and tear down environments without manual steps.
